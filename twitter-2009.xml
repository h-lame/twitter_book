<tweet>12:32pm&#160;&#160;You'd need 10million people that did *nothing* but consume pirated content to even come close to £120billion consumed. A nonsense number.</tweet>

<tweet>10:15am&#160;&#160;I should be a big fan of straightstatistics.org - but, it's just not very good. <link>http://bit.ly/5sYp46</link> Is this variation really significant?</tweet>
<tweet>01:45pm&#160;&#160;Hmm - find out if your friends a) buy a lot of porn b) eat a lot of burgers or c) are taking mistresses to the theatre. <link>http://blippy.com/</link></tweet>

<tweet>01:56pm&#160;&#160;If the agents of the state saw me struggle with OpenOffice they'd conclude I lack 'key skills' and I'd be marched into remedial school.</tweet>

<tweet>02:17pm&#160;&#160;Not sure if I trust my accountant - he puts his name at the bottom of letters in a Comic-Sans-like font and pretends its a signature.</tweet>

<tweet>04:00pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> that's almost as big as their 'teach your pet sign language' section!</tweet>
<tweet>08:55pm&#160;&#160;For once my machine isn't going slowly because of Flash - it's going slowly because of AIR. Sod you Adobe, your software sucks.</tweet>
<tweet>09:24pm&#160;&#160;Dead-drop: want to send a link to a streetview and for example, hide a present 'where we first met, behind the pillarbox'. Anyone made this?</tweet>
<tweet>09:30pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - was thinking that they'd have to hunt it down on Streetview. So the lat/lon/orientation become a sort of password.</tweet>

<tweet>01:55pm&#160;&#160;Unpaid internship seems to me the most regressive of business practices - If they're working, they should be paid.</tweet>
<tweet>02:04pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - most of them are. If you've a contract, written or not, you'd be classed a 'worker'.  I think there's also a charities exemption.</tweet>
<tweet>02:24pm&#160;&#160;<name>@danlucraft</name> Not for me, though I see what you're saying. I read novels on it.</tweet>

<tweet>12:29am&#160;&#160;<name>@delineator</name> - I've no problem with the ideal of proportionality, but all proposed mechanisms fail by privileging the political party.</tweet>
<tweet>12:30am&#160;&#160;<name>@delineator</name> - one of the reasons I like AV is that I think it's the most robust defence against tactical voting.</tweet>
<tweet>12:45am&#160;&#160;<name>@delineator</name> - who's arguing for FPTP? Whipping's a separate issue. And I bet the NZ coalitions have their share of secret horse-trading.</tweet>

<tweet>12:37pm&#160;&#160;Child's Marlon Brando impersonation is so good now that if they cast Apocalypse Now with toddlers he'd be a shoo-in. <hashtag>#babysteps</hashtag></tweet>
<tweet>12:43pm&#160;&#160;Is there an online equivalent of Private Eye? The Eye's lost much of its power by not being webby. I understand why they did that, though.</tweet>
<tweet>03:56pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> are they as important to the national debate now? Plenty of ways to make profit.</tweet>
<tweet>03:57pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> their circulation's always been much smaller than their influence. Former may be growing, latter isn't.</tweet>
<tweet>04:03pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> I understand the motives, but it's a shame. We need public institutions like the Eye and the forum now the web, not the newstand.</tweet>
<tweet>04:32pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> it's not really about me being able to read it, it's about it being able to be shared, linked to, etc.</tweet>
<tweet>05:11pm&#160;&#160;<name>@tom_watson</name> - poll mentioned in your blog post? <link>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/the_daily_politics/8538724.stm</link></tweet>
<tweet>05:23pm&#160;&#160;So, here's the thing. I've just re-read a book I bought in 1987. Will I be able to read my ebooks in 23 years' time?</tweet>
<tweet>05:24pm&#160;&#160;Oh, am pretty sure I will be able to read this book again in another 23 years. If I survive that long.</tweet>
<tweet>05:35pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - depends how you define suffering, right? The recent Carter-Ruck thing was made for them, but they turned up late, I think...</tweet>
<tweet>05:37pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - although they published Farrelly's question early, it didn't get them any credit.</tweet>
<tweet>05:38pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - I put that down to not having the same influence as they used to. Also, the Guardian played that well across many channels.</tweet>
<tweet>05:43pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - ah, here you go: <link>http://bit.ly/axvLwP</link> Doesn't Hislop's quote here speak volumes? Published first, but didn't ignite the fire.</tweet>
<tweet>05:44pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - I'm happy to accept that that may not be entirely down to having no internet engagement, but I think it's part of it.</tweet>
<tweet>07:18pm&#160;&#160;Fascinated by this. Did the same thing in 2002 and it bombed. <link>http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp</link>?1007 I think it might be the copy changes.</tweet>
<tweet>08:16pm&#160;&#160;Who are these 'professional content pirates'? No-one gets paid to upload torrents or make usenet archives, do they?</tweet>
<tweet>08:32pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrsoz</name> - the published circulation figures predate the trafigura story. Am an Eye fan. And I think its influence should be greater online.</tweet>
<tweet>09:10pm&#160;&#160;Child loves his mp3 radio. He's now learnt to skip the tracks until it plays Heigh Ho. Have heard it many, many times this week. <hashtag>#babysteps</hashtag></tweet>

<tweet>12:05am&#160;&#160;Hah! I love the way this article's headline assumes that the Mail had any credibility and that it even cares: <link>http://bit.ly/ddDmGp</link></tweet>
<tweet>12:09am&#160;&#160;Interesting graph showing distribution of scientific opinion on man-made climate change and media coverage. <link>http://bit.ly/aFiZoa</link></tweet>
<tweet>12:48am&#160;&#160;Wish I hadn't read this article by Nick Clegg - it's much less inspiring than the sub-editor's deck makes it sound. <link>http://bit.ly/df6zNb</link></tweet>
<tweet>12:58am&#160;&#160;Gordon Brown's contribution is awful too. <link>http://bit.ly/aSMwti</link> Read it twice, still not clear what he's trying to say.</tweet>
<tweet>01:01am&#160;&#160;Cameron's is better written - although the structure is a bit 'rhetoric for dummies', it's effective. <link>http://bit.ly/brBBb2</link></tweet>
<tweet>01:08am&#160;&#160;Reading Clegg's again. Someone needs to beat those clichés out of him. And those opening lines? Urrgh. 'I basically believe' - hmm...</tweet>
<tweet>11:55am&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> Yes, come round!</tweet>
<tweet>12:32pm&#160;&#160;Britain a 'complete and utter mess'? What more proof do you need? <link>http://bit.ly/bRspkU</link> Oh... wait.</tweet>
<tweet>05:46pm&#160;&#160;<name>@danlucraft</name> Ughh. Almost as bad as some of my code. Are there tests? Can it be refactored, I see much duplication?</tweet>
<tweet>07:55pm&#160;&#160;I'm finding it hard to support the BBC and its 'unique' funding. To me, it's becoming just another grubby corporation. <link>http://bit.ly/b1a87U</link></tweet>
<tweet>09:52pm&#160;&#160;Too few legislators realise that using internet means copying. Streaming, p2p, webpages, email - all copy bytes from thither to hither.</tweet>

<tweet>10:07pm&#160;&#160;"Firewalls do not allow access to a number of sites, such as those containing Flash technology." Do they know what they're talking about?</tweet>
<tweet>10:12pm&#160;&#160;It's ridiculous to suggest that individuals have access to sufficient bandwidth to enable file-sharing (sic) and that cafés, etc. don't.</tweet>
<tweet>10:27pm&#160;&#160;My blog is copyrighted. By browsing it you copy it to your machine. If you visit it 3 times, can I get your internet cut off?</tweet>
<tweet>10:27pm&#160;&#160;Maybe I'll put a licence on there that allows copying by anyone except government IP addresses...</tweet>
<tweet>10:30pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chneukirchen</name> - Maybe I just want to read it myself. If I leave a door unlocked, can you enter my house and steal my stuff?</tweet>
<tweet>10:31pm&#160;&#160;<name>@robertbrook</name> - thought you were parliament. That's ok, right?</tweet>
<tweet>10:34pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - it's quite amazing, isn't it. I do wonder what miss-using a connection was on page 6. Perhaps they've banned dictionaries.</tweet>
<tweet>10:36pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chneukirchen</name> Indeed you can. But not without committing a crime.</tweet>
<tweet>10:41pm&#160;&#160;Government should come clean: if you operate internet-connected wifi, there's no technical way you can prevent copy infringement.</tweet>
<tweet>10:58pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chneukirchen</name> - Nice. I think the point is that copyright doesn't work on the internet. Both positions can lead to absurd situations.</tweet>

<tweet>08:18pm&#160;&#160;What does it mean to say 'I'm a capitalist'? It's the system we all live within, but to identify oneself as one. Odd, if you ask me.</tweet>
<tweet>08:19pm&#160;&#160;(oh, that last post came from seeing someone calling themselves a 'capitalist' in their twitter profile).</tweet>
<tweet>08:39pm&#160;&#160;Pleased <name>@TCEurope</name> posted a rebuttal to that whiny (and somewhat odd) start-up post from a couple of weeks' ago. <link>http://bit.ly/b6sdol</link></tweet>
<tweet>09:14pm&#160;&#160;Mark Thompson says the BBC "has a special role to develop and back open platforms and standards." <link>http://bit.ly/d7XbWP</link> And yet...</tweet>
<tweet>09:37pm&#160;&#160;Given the lunacy at the fringes of the Tory parliamentary party, a small Tory majority would be the worst of all possible worlds.</tweet>

<tweet>12:48am&#160;&#160;Human rights are inalienable and not part of some societal rights/responsibilities comic book morality. <link>http://bit.ly/8Xx327</link> Well said.</tweet>
<tweet>12:41pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - if it's a work machine, you're probably not entitled to enter into those agreements anyway. :)</tweet>
<tweet>12:49pm&#160;&#160;Bah, licence fee should be taken from general taxation - it's obscene that these huge salaries are paid from a regressive tax.</tweet>
<tweet>02:15pm&#160;&#160;Not a fan of BBC6Music or BBC4 - just ways of keeping excellent programming segregated. I think they're in principle bad. Sorry folks.</tweet>
<tweet>02:25pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> I think it does. I think being accidentally exposed to things outside your specific choice is an important public virtue.</tweet>
<tweet>02:25pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - isn't that what I'm talking about - the idea that channels are 'full' of something is what I'm against.</tweet>
<tweet>02:34pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - I was talking about the 'full of pop crap' station. It sounds to me like BBC6's ethos should be thinly spread throughout the BBC.</tweet>
<tweet>02:35pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - and this 'channel for teens', 'channel for 25-45', 'channel for news' actually prevents that happening. To public detriment.</tweet>
<tweet>02:52pm&#160;&#160;<name>@grahamashton</name> I'm sure that's true. But, there are side effects. Channels become more targeted; audiences more segregated, no?</tweet>
<tweet>02:54pm&#160;&#160;<name>@oneplusiphoto</name> - no, I think I'm suggesting the more channels you have, The less you're doing public broadcasting. Not very clearly, though!</tweet>
<tweet>02:58pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> Sure. But is that the aim of the BBC? Should it be? I don't think it's the most important aim - but I'm an elitist about this.</tweet>
<tweet>03:00pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - exactly. I'm just saying that the existence of BBC6 and BBC4 make that a bit harder.</tweet>
<tweet>03:01pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - that's an interesting idea. The BBC should make space for niches in the mainstream. Niche channels may make that harder.</tweet>
<tweet>03:17pm&#160;&#160;Bah. Have to write a blog post now. Right, where can I get mid-80s TV schedules?</tweet>
<tweet>03:19pm&#160;&#160;<name>@robertbrook</name> - I'm increasingly convinced that the TV Go Home listings were sent back from the near future. They're prophesy, not satire.</tweet>
<tweet>05:30pm&#160;&#160;Is there a big vault of unseen documentaries where they uncovered 'the true scale' of something and it was smaller than you'd think?</tweet>
<tweet>05:42pm&#160;&#160;Thinking of making a documentary to 'uncover the true scale of model trains'. I think it's conventionally 1:76 or thereabouts.</tweet>
<tweet>05:42pm&#160;&#160;Damn, just spoiled it for everyone.</tweet>
<tweet>05:48pm&#160;&#160;Oh boy, shouldn't have mentioned model trains. It was a joke - not about model trains, about documentaries. Please, be gentle, model nuts.</tweet>
<tweet>05:48pm&#160;&#160;Ok, I'm sorry, I of course mean model enthusiasts. Not my day on twitter.</tweet>

<tweet>12:02am&#160;&#160;<name>@maccman</name> - there are many advantages to having functions that close over the same lexical environment - it's not really for optimisation.</tweet>
<tweet>12:55am&#160;&#160;"Mrs Cameron is not a natural Labour supporter – but she was a black-clad ‘goth’ in her teens." Um ok, Daily Mail, you've convinced me...</tweet>
<tweet>12:58am&#160;&#160;<name>@oneplusiphoto</name> Yes I think we should be told how their children, their mistresses, their maids and their manservants vote too....</tweet>
<tweet>01:04am&#160;&#160;<name>@oneplusiphoto</name> frankly, it would be easier if there were a vote per household. The man of the house is usually best placed to make the call.</tweet>
<tweet>04:18pm&#160;&#160;Have escaped new office - bloody cold there; am guessing heating pumps affected by power cut.</tweet>
<tweet>05:58pm&#160;&#160;Watching child eat his way through a babybel... before suddenly realising he's eaten the wax too. Uhoh. <hashtag>#babysteps</hashtag></tweet>

<tweet>08:05pm&#160;&#160;<name>@chrismdp</name> - oh. My bad. I'll fix that. I guess pasties don't last forever.</tweet>
<tweet>09:08pm&#160;&#160;Let me put it this way: I'd only give you my phone number if you'd promise never to phone me. You see? That's why you can't have it.</tweet>
<tweet>09:54pm&#160;&#160;BBC news asks 'who would you give the Oscar to?' Surely 'to whom would you give the Oscar'? Getting out my green pen.</tweet>
<tweet>09:55pm&#160;&#160;I'm guessing they didn't know where to put the apostrophe in Venables either - <link>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/default.stm</link></tweet>
<tweet>09:57pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - it's not the hanging participle with which I have a problem (!) - more the case of who.</tweet>
<tweet>09:59pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - admittedly, I don't care that much.</tweet>

<tweet>01:58am&#160;&#160;Video made me laugh. <link>http://bit.ly/aSfGFX</link> (One of the worst engineers I've come across scored 90-odd % on their java certification).</tweet>

<tweet>12:39pm&#160;&#160;<name>@knaveofdiamonds</name> oh yeah? <link>http://www.out</link>-law.com/page-5609 Oh look, the law's an ass.</tweet>
<tweet>12:40pm&#160;&#160;<name>@knaveofdiamonds</name> it's hard to believe that the courts would come down against hyperlinking, but, who knows?</tweet>
<tweet>02:57pm&#160;&#160;<name>@threedaymonk</name> - I believe that's technically known as the Scunthorpe error.</tweet>
<tweet>03:12pm&#160;&#160;<name>@jodrell</name> - I believe it was actually Scabbagethorpe. How we laughed.</tweet>
<tweet>03:39pm&#160;&#160;RT <name>@fidothe</name>: Via someone or other: <link>http://bit.ly/9ds9e2</link> -- youtube shuts down for the night.</tweet>
<tweet>05:32pm&#160;&#160;There seem to be very confused ideas about when to provide an API to access government data versus just publishing the data as, say, CSV.</tweet>
<tweet>05:36pm&#160;&#160;Some clues: a Gb of data is no longer a big data-set; historical data does not need timely updates; API keys not required to measure usage.</tweet>
<tweet>07:11pm&#160;&#160;I don't understand why Adobe wouldn't want people disassembling flash files. Imagine how small the web would be without 'view source'.</tweet>
<tweet>08:27pm&#160;&#160;<link>http://bit.ly/ayucun</link> Um, this is proper Tory logic: be kind to monopolies while talking up market-led competition. Barmy. (via <name>@currybet</name>)</tweet>
<tweet>08:28pm&#160;&#160;Not that Labour's much better on the monopolist front, but they don't seem as two-faced to me on these issues.</tweet>
<tweet>08:40pm&#160;&#160;Beards? "while the chin-borne cumulus of the Victorian patriarchs may have blown away, they continue to be worn" <link>http://tinyurl.com/yc53sc6</link></tweet>

<tweet>09:06pm&#160;&#160;<name>@robertbrook</name> - this may now be my favourite found poetry: <link>http://www.drunkenboat.com/db10/08poe/rambo/blood.html</link></tweet>
<tweet>10:09pm&#160;&#160;Have just watched a 15-minute video with my headphones on, but not plugged in. Was wondering why it sounded muffled. Still, warm ears.</tweet>
<tweet>10:16pm&#160;&#160;I remember a book about BASIC with cartoon illustrations by, I think, Bill Tidy. Did I dream that? Why am I asking twitter and not google?</tweet>
<tweet>10:38pm&#160;&#160;Ok, so Bill Tidy is on twitter. Maybe I should ask him. But... <link>http://twitter.com/BillTidy/status/9846331830</link></tweet>
<tweet>10:39pm&#160;&#160;<name>@BillTidy</name> - I remember an early 80s computer programming book that you illustrated. Do I remember rightly? I can't remember the title.</tweet>

<tweet>11:56am&#160;&#160;Looking forward to <name>@lrug</name> tonight.</tweet>

<tweet>01:09am&#160;&#160;<name>@jrep</name> oh, I've not come across it before. Seemed very much informed by tagging and loose hierarchies. I assumed an interweb sensibility.</tweet>
<tweet>01:14am&#160;&#160;<name>@jrep</name> I mean, you're surely right. It felt very modern though. I'm probably just a sucker for round corners.</tweet>
<tweet>01:15am&#160;&#160;<name>@jrep</name> - oh wait. Was rounded corners 2004?</tweet>
<tweet>01:16am&#160;&#160;What the hell is this nonsense, and poorly written nonsense at that, doing on the BBC? <link>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8551808.stm</link></tweet>

<tweet>09:53pm&#160;&#160;<name>@robertbrook</name> - I thought it might be the 'sticky-back plastic' of the moden age. I only realised they meant sellotape in my twenties...</tweet>

<tweet>10:51pm&#160;&#160;<name>@nevali</name> - I guess channel 4 haven't licensed YouTube the right to show it in the UK. It's the BrassEye subliminal advertising clip, so ...</tweet>
<tweet>10:51pm&#160;&#160;<name>@nevali</name> - ... it's certainly illegal to broadcast it in the UK.</tweet>
<tweet>10:52pm&#160;&#160;<name>@nevali</name> - yeah. But you know. Only people like us ask questions.</tweet>

<day name="Friday 26 March">
<tweet>12:30pm&#160;&#160;So the big question is whether the Times is going to disappear from Google. Or will they follow the FT's halfway house solution.</tweet>
<tweet>12:35pm&#160;&#160;I have a lot of sympathy for Michael Martin's defence of the UK libel laws - he was savaged by an idiotic media. But, he's wrong on this.</tweet>
<tweet>12:48pm&#160;&#160;<name>@aliceeleanor8</name> - try to be brave.</tweet>
<tweet>12:52pm&#160;&#160;Wondering when the government's going to set up a Department for Internet Freedom - dedicated to censorship, of course.</tweet>

<tweet>01:53pm&#160;&#160;<name>@lukeredpath</name> - agreed. I like explaining it as a tactic to avoid returning null/nil from functions, or as a useful typed nil value.</tweet>

<tweet>02:10pm&#160;&#160;Eventually this will end with people coming round to my house and shouting through the letterbox. "Did you get my email? Did you?"</tweet>

<tweet>04:51pm&#160;&#160;April is starting to look busy - well, by my standards anyway.</tweet>
<tweet>05:02pm&#160;&#160;Guardian random app fills a void in my life. I used to get all my news on random fish and chip papers. Health and Safety put an end to that.</tweet>
